### Investigating gene expression changes at the initial stages of _Plasmodium berghei_ mosquito midgut development using an RNA sequencing pipeline - Master of Research in Biomedical Sciences project at the University of Glasgow

#This project involved exploratory analysis of RNA-seq data from the mosquito midgut stages of the _Plasmodium berghei_ parasite. The aim was to determine the changes in gene expression profiles during the development of an immature, female gametocyte into a mature ookinete.  It was hypothesised that there would be gradual changes in gene expression and that the expression of genes involved in ookinete motility and midgut invasion would increase with time. These data were generated by Dr Katarzyna Modrzynska's laboratory by culturing three different _P.berghei_ strains (RM, AP2-O, GFPcon) _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ and isolating RNA at 7 time points during mosquito midgut development - 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24hrs.
