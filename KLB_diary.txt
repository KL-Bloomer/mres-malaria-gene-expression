Kirstin's diary - https://github.com/KL-Bloomer/mres-malaria-gene-expression

#Week 1 (1-5 March)
###
# Managed to get onto the computer cluster
# Created a GitHub repository
# Installed conda and bioconda
# Created a virtual environment where I installed the packages necessary for the data analysis using the requirements.txt file (nelson)
# Downloaded the P.berghei genome
# Re-cap biology on the command line


#Week 2 (8-12 March)
###
# Download the genome annotation
# Index reference genome
# Read quality control - fastqc
# Read alignment to the genome - hisat2
# Install IGV and observed read coverage
# Count the number of reads that align to genes from each sample - featureCounts
# Perform the above on all of the datasets from the cluster and the Snakefile
# Recap biology on the command line & ngs


#Week 3 (15-19 March)
# Re-run snakefile - concatenate mouse and P.berghei genomes and re-run the alignment
# Analayse the data
# Read coverage with IGV and take snapshots of key ookinete genes
# Blast unmapped reads 
# Theory of differential expression
# Brush up on R & plotting
# PCA plot

##Week 4 (22-26 March)
# MDS plot - ggplot & re-do without outliers & Dim2 vs Dim3
# Troubleshoot blast...last step
# Remove rRNA count reads and see how it alters the MDS plot(s)
# Validation of the literature

##Week 5 (29 March-2 April)
# re-run the snakefile with female gametocyte data (0hr) and generate MDS plot 
# Add labels to MDS plot
# Work on library barplot - ggplot
# idxstat table & percentage for counts.summary.report table - finalise tables
# Generate MA plot for female gametocyte data as well
# Do some reading up of the literature
#Volcano plot, global expression plot & snakemake workflow plot
#Differential gene expression analysis
# Snakemake tutorial
# work on tables and take better pictures of key ookinete genes (igv)
