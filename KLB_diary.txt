Kirstin's diary - https://github.com/KL-Bloomer/mres-malaria-gene-expression

#Week 1 (1-5 March)
###
# Managed to get onto the computer cluster
# Created a GitHub repository
# Installed conda and bioconda
# Created a virtual environment where I installed the packages necessary for the data analysis using the requirements.txt file (nelson)
# Downloaded the P.berghei genome
# Re-cap biology on the command line


#Week 2 (8-12 March)
###
# Download the genome annotation
# Index reference genome
# Read quality control - fastqc
# Read alignment to the genome - hisat2
# Install IGV and observed read coverage
# Count the number of reads that align to genes from each sample - featureCounts
# Perform the above on all of the datasets from the cluster and the Snakefile
# Recap biology on the command line & ngs


#Week 3 (15-19 March)
# Re-run snakefile - concatenate mouse and P.berghei genomes and re-run the alignment
# Analayse the data
# Read coverage with IGV and take snapshots of key ookinete genes
# Blast unmapped reads 
# Theory of differential expression
# Brush up on R & plotting
# PCA plot

##Week 4 (22-26 March)
# MDS plot - ggplot & re-do without outliers & Dim2 vs Dim3
# Troubleshoot blast...last step
# Remove rRNA count reads and see how it alters the MDS plot(s)
# Validation of the literature

##Week 5 (29 March-2 April)
# re-run the snakefile with female gametocyte data (0hr) and generate MDS plot 
# Add labels to MDS plot
# Work on library barplot - ggplot
# idxstat table & percentage for counts.summary.report table - finalise tables
# Generate MA plot for female gametocyte data as well
# Do some reading up of the literature
#Differential gene expression analysis

##Week 6 (5-9 April)
# Volcano plot, global expression plot & snakemake workflow plot
# Batch correction included to MDS, MA, volcano & global gene expression plots
# clustering & heatmaps

##Week 7 (12-16 April)
# Write up intro - plan send to Kasia
# Write up methods
# Volcano plot - p-value <0.01

##Week 8 (19-23 April)
# heatmap & clustering - hclust = average, complete, median & ward.D
			- distance = correlation matrix
			- cluster into groups
			- logrpkm counts
			- logFC, logrpkm for all genes & FDR < 0.01
# take pictures of DEG with Gviz
# plot changes in gene expression over time

##Week 9 (26-30 April)
# GO
# sort out Snakefile and README.md
# put results together
# introduction, methods
# project proposal
					
##Week 10 (3-7 May) - week 14 (1-4 June)
#Write up lab report and project proposal for submission on 1 June
#fix graphs, organise cluster and scripts
#write up poster abstract for BSP conference & submit
#plan for the following 3 months of research

##Week 15 (7-11 June)
#GO and motif enrichment
#plan figures for poster & prepare for JC presentation
# read literature so that you can be prepared for viva on 18 June

##Week 16 (14-18 June)
#JC presentation (15 June)
#Prepare poster for conference

##Week 17 (21-25 June)
#BSP conference
#AP2 and pathway enrichment analysis

##Week 18 (28 June-2 July)
#HOLIDAY

##Week 19 (5-9 July)
#Motif enrichment analysis
#Custom scripts - enrichment of conoid/apical proteins

##Week 20 (12-16 July)
#Lab induction & admin
#Isolation of asexual parasites from blood, DNA extraction and PCR
#Motif enrichment run - promoter length, negclst files and generic background files

#Week 21 (19-23 July)
#Isolation of asexual parasites from blood and treat sample with TRIZOL in preparation for RNA extraction 
#could not complete RNA extraction due to no longer being allowed in the lab
#pictures of blood stage parasites
#Motif enrichment troubleshoot negclst runs & analyse data
#AP2 target gene plots - average gene Z-score - need to troubleshoot

#Week 22 (26-30 July)
#Finish troubleshooting AP2 target gene plot
#Motif enrichment - run with meme diabled to see if it affects the results for cluster 7 and 8 (with small dataset)
#re-run analysis without 12hr timepoint
#DOZI enrichment?
#Start writing up introduction and methods
#putting data together - create the story
