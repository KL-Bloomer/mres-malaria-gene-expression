Kirstin's diary - https://github.com/KL-Bloomer/mres-malaria-gene-expression

#Week 1 (1-5 March)
###
# Managed to get onto the computer cluster
# Created a GitHub repository
# Installed conda and bioconda
# Created a virtual environment where I installed the packages necessary for the data analysis using the requirements.txt file (nelson)
# Downloaded the P.berghei genome
# Re-cap biology on the command line


#Week 2 (8-12 March)
###
# Download the genome annotation
# Index reference genome
# Read quality control - fastqc
# Read alignment to the genome - hisat2
# Install IGV and observed read coverage
# Count the number of reads that align to genes from each sample - featureCounts
# Perform the above on all of the datasets from the cluster and the Snakefile
# Recap biology on the command line & ngs


#Week 3 (15-19 March)
# Read coverage with IGV and take snapshots of key ookinete genes
# Theory of differential expression
# Brush up on R & plotting
